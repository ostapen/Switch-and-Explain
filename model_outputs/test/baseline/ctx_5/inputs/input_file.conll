  comiendo mierda [EOT]  no i did like a bunch of stuff [EOU]  i did all my trabajo [EOT]  i did n't [EOT]  pick [EOT]  i said 
  i remember one of the first things i thought [EOU]  i mean it 's a national monument [EOU]  it 's a park [EOU]  but you know [EOU]  we are a land obsessed with [EOU]  you 
  like that girl that i told you about that i like i went out for like a for like a month she was like she 's working on her masters now and it 's like like you just feel bad for her [EOU]  like honestly that 's the only thing i can tell you [EOU]  like i felt bad for her [EOU]  because like there 's nothing you can do like [EOU]  you know it 's like she 'sthirty and she still has n't figured out that you know if she does n't like put on the batteries like she 's justgon na be alone for like the rest of her life like [EOT]  oh my

  just the thing is [EOT]  i 'm trying to learn like one thing i 'm trying to change about myself now is like [EOU]  because like you 're though like these last couple of months man like it 's been hitting me hard like [EOU]  like like now i 'm trying to like realize like man like [EOU]  i used to be so happy all the time you know [EOU]  and then like there like they used to be 
  really [EOT]  and i should n't have missed today [EOU]  but the thing is like i should n't have missed it [EOU]  but i just could n't get up [EOT]  and how do you feel now [EOT]  i do
