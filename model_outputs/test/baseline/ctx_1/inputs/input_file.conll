  no pero te te voy a decir una cosa que un dia [EOU]  cuando juan era un undercover 
  oh the s_t_s cars [EOT]  si 
  porque probablemente el sabado si vas a party con nosotros vamos a venir tarde [EOU]  tienes que dormir en la casa 
  i would take a change of clothing [EOU]  y y me lavaba los sobacos 
  you never know [EOU]  you always have 
  lo que va a haber un poco frio [EOT]  and and um it 's not a popular cruise ship 
  and he played it off [EOU]  whatever i 
  mami [EOU]  no usar 
  that they had you know done a whole bunch of things [EOU]  i know exactly who they were talking 
  i was an average student [EOU]  i i had 
  it should be coming in soon [EOT]  ten to twelve

  anyway my father used to tease her [EOU]  because

  some of the catches she did n't catch [EOU]  and she caught things that they did n't catch 
  yeah like in that face well she would give me an answer sometimes [EOU]  she would also use that face to dodge 
  por que [EOT]  i 'm not interested 
  no mira la esposa de lopez fue muy buena mujer [EOU]  por eso yo el dia veinte de marzo que ella cumple anos de ella hubiera cumplido anos no 
  anyways there will be more [EOU]  ok

  mmhm [EOT]  but whatever 
  and clean it up [EOT]  este descalzado 
  turn the t_v on [EOU]  do something quiet 
  donde podemos estar [EOU]  y ustedes tu sabes caminan 
  mmhm [EOT]  you know i think of it in that in 
  i know [EOU]  i 
  como que el cancer en el pancreas avanza mas rapido [EOU]  hace 
  ah no entonces fue un accidente [EOU]  cuando vuelvo vengo para donde yo estaba sentado adelante con pablo veo que pablo no es no puede hablar 
  no i had a really good time when i went to santo_domingo [EOU]  also had a really good 
  pero yo siempre estoy echando [EOU]  si yo se que tengo hormigas le echo cosas para las hormigas las 
  you know take in a a joyous activity you know [EOU]  so 
  you know how they normally give you like the sheet which the guy the doctor actually has to interpret and say [EOU]  we 
  no [EOT]  y tu como tu aprendes el spelling de las palabras 
  and then like on my father 's side of the family i do n't know what they 'regon na do with that [EOU]  i do n't know if they 'regon na introduce 
  they tool her off dialysis [EOU]  she 's still in i_c_u whatever 
  i do n't know why somebody did that [EOU]  yo no cerre la puerta 
  oh that really sucks you know [EOU]  but i just never brought it up 
  that 's a home [EOU]  it 
  goody i think it is [EOT]  no 
  why do n't we just put like you know one fan at at the end of eachrow blowing down [EOT]  no uh the the fans are the paper 
  olvida te marga [EOU]  is she coming

  i want the heater [EOU]  would be 
  what happened [EOU]  and 
  but i mean think of it [EOT]  does that happen to you

  we ca n't [EOU]  we 're too social 
  mmhm mmhm [EOT]  yo dije 
  just because you have an education does n't mean squat like [EOT]  it 
  she would also use that face to dodge me [EOU]  so she kind of like her face getsstone cold when she 's trying to dodge people 
  pobrecito [EOU]  i felt bad for it that he said that 
  no because we put it really high high enough for only his head [EOT]  un pedacito de cristal

  and we got the prototypes jeff [EOU]  so we got ta to 
  you know [EOT]  you 're trap 
  y entonces la senora se se iba a ir fuera [EOU]  y annabel y jaime
