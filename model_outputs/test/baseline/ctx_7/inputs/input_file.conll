  no no no being merry [EOT]  what [EOU]  so unlike you [EOT]  but ah so the whole idea was that but like vacilar se it has this it has this extra component built into the word of um of processing [EOU]  it 's not just visually [EOU]  it 's not it 's because you see you ca n't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like i checked out that girl [EOU]  you ca n't say like i checked her [EOU]  it 
  that the house was supertiny [EOT]  that they do n't clean up [EOT]  and it was really piggy [EOU]  right it was really piggy whatever [EOU]  so tommy tells me [EOU]  oh my god this guy 'sgon na do a barbecue [EOU]  imaginate tu [EOU]  and me da pena

  i mean i 'm i 'm i think she deserves respect just as an individual [EOU]  but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically [EOU]  it 's a matter of in the proceedings [EOU]  the proceedings have to be treated with respect [EOU]  because given that it 's so wishy washy given that it 's so shifty and unstructured respect isgon na factor in [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  you know if we 're aggressive if we 're you know assholish if we 're whatever then [EOT]  yeah you

  but it is an opportunity to go [EOU]  but they are not open to the public like are [EOU]  but the space does n't does n't comfortably feel that way [EOU]  right but we can send sonia or [EOU]  or hannah [EOU]  right right right [EOU]  no it 's really the style [EOU]  you know 
  he 's a big guy [EOT]  yeah you get over it [EOT]  and then you see some really fat guy [EOU]  and you go [EOU]  wow that guy 's fat [EOT]  oh wow that guy 's huge [EOT]  and then you sit there and go [EOT]  oh 
  no [EOU]  let 's not get back into that [EOT]  por que [EOT]  i 'm not interested [EOT]  te sientes como un poco atacado en cierta manera con eso [EOT]  no que me importa [EOU]  eso eso no me importa [EOU]  y ya 
  era esa [EOU]  estoy casi segura de que era esa [EOU]  esa misma es [EOU]  no esa no es [EOU]  no esa no es [EOU]  no tienen opcion de blanco [EOU]  they have a nice colour [EOU]  i do n't 
  um [EOT]  oh yeah [EOT]  i feel the same way you do about me [EOT]  oh if we go over fivethirty [EOU]  oh oh she emailed me back [EOU]  the lady from flamingo_gardens [EOT]  and what did she say [EOT]  she said that we can 
  and it 's very popular [EOT]  look how beautiful the gazebo is for the ceremony [EOT]  it 's a nice gazebo [EOU]  but [EOT]  oh my god stop saying [EOT]  wait ok [EOU]  but what will happen in there [EOU]  just

  y por que no la cogieron [EOT]  maybe it was because [EOU]  i do n't know [EOU]  maybe it was because that she had her grades low [EOU]  because if you have an f or maybe more than one f you ca n't go into the team [EOT]  ah [EOU]  oh oh [EOT]  maybe

  what 's that called the like the the [EOT]  recoil [EOT]  recoil [EOU]  i wasgon na say backlash [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  but it 's essentially the same [EOT]  it 's pretty much the same thing [EOU]  but when you 're 
  like because like my whole idea is that [EOT]  it 's always no big deal [EOT]  it 's always no big deal you know [EOU]  like had she been here had she been here i would have told her [EOU]  because i told her about the event [EOU]  i told her that evening i spoke to her [EOU]  i was like [EOU]  oh like this 
  i know [EOT]  that 's not the point [EOU]  the point is going together and having a good time [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and i know you wanted to go to the concert [EOU]  so it was important you know that you had a good time [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  so when you tell me 
  how about that [EOU]  that 's her special talent [EOU]  dammit i did n't know that was a special talent [EOU]  because if i woulda thought that was a special talent i woulda kept on doing it [EOT] america 's most talented [EOT]  i do n't know [EOU]  apparently that 's a special talent [EOU]  well anyways so i told him so a couple of people from work have mentioned 
  tu no sabes sembrar la [EOT]  yo tengo una cosa con con tres pibos asi que es como un como una pala [EOU]  que yo pienso vaya [EOU]  uno puede coger lo [EOU]  y meter lo en la tierra [EOU]  y hacer le asi [EOU]  y hacer un hueco asi you know [EOT]  si 
  i think [EOT]  it 's like um [EOT]  i think i 'm i swear i 'm big [EOT]  it 's kind of like with andrew [EOU]  i know andrew 's huge [EOU]  but i 've known him for so long [EOU]  it does n't shock me any_more [EOU]  it does n't 
  yo nunca las he visto por ahi [EOT]  lo ponen ahi [EOU]  lo ponen ahi [EOU]  la unica manera que una cucaracha esa cucaracha puede estar en mi casa sin morir se [EOU]  porque en el piso por todo el piso yo ellos tienen el veneno dos meses [EOT]  si [EOT]  yo encuentro una buena y sana en mi casa es porque entro por por el sink [EOU]  te lo 
  but i mean think of it [EOT]  does that happen to you with the shortness [EOU]  like i i know that i 'm short [EOU]  but i do n't realize it until [EOT]  i i think i 'm big [EOT]  until either i 'm standing next to someone very tall or i see someone very short [EOU]  like the other day i was in publix [EOU]  and i i 
  so you have uh again like a professor of french say french professor [EOU]  whereas in spanish you do n't have that [EOT]  that 's right you do n't [EOT]  there is that there is no [EOT]  there 's always de [EOT]  yeah profesor de frances [EOU]  if you say if you say profesor frances [EOT]  it means a french

  so i 'm going by the contract [EOU]  el que me diga [EOU]  pero ademas ella no esta haciendo nada [EOU]  claro las dos sabemos que lo que queremos es que se vaya para el carajo pero [EOU]  pero ahi si que puede ella documentar [EOU]  porque ahi ella si que tiene que tener las cosas bien organizadas [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  i think katie isgon na 
  there will be [EOU]  and i 'mgon na make sure that you go that you go with me the next one [EOU]  because i feel really bad [EOT]  for that [EOT]  not for that [EOU]  but i know you wanted to go too so [EOT]  yeah ok [EOU]  no comment 
  yeah [EOT]  what were you watching on t_v [EOT]  ah [EOT]  what [EOT]  hannah_montana [EOT]  hannah_montana [EOT]  mami [EOT]  yes 
  yeah yeah [EOT]  like i guess i guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um isabella a little bit better [EOU]  you know my cynthia 's son [EOT]  oh yeah [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  and probably fernando because honestly like i do n't know either of them like any of them like luis you know junior luis like [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and fernando 
  yeah [EOT]  i did n't i did n't [EOT]  i felt really bad [EOU]  but i just felt the whole thing was just misunderstood [EOU]  it was [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  all right i do n't want to talk about it any_more [EOU]  it 's like old 
  he is so cute [EOT]  he 's yeah he 's he 's like [EOT]  he 's good looking [EOU]  like indio but like really good looking yeah yeah [EOT]  yeah yeah yeah [EOT]  yeah yeah he 'sgon na be a cutie [EOU]  hopefully he 'll be taller than his dad [EOT]  that 
  they 're the people that were giving away the tickets for the the concert [EOT]  oh for the concert [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  really [EOT]  i never called [EOU]  but i should have called [EOT]  yeah you should [EOT]  i probably woulda won some 
  actually no the reason why is because like like i kind of felt bad like about what happened [EOU]  and i do n't really want like for me to be the issue like between you and my mom [EOU]  you know like i do n't want that i do n't want myself to come up in like anyway or form possible like [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and it 's and like kind of i was just kind of like [EOU]  well you know like like i do n't know what to do [EOU]  because the thing is like the thing is i you know [EOT]  mmhm 
  yeah sometimes i have friends [EOU]  and then sometimes i change my mind [EOU]  and then they are not my friends any_more [EOU]  depending on the conversation [EOT]  what about your friend nick [EOU]  your friend nick does the manicure also [EOT]  no [EOU]  not at 
  aha [EOU]  mira como mira asi eran de grandes [EOT]  y eran dulces [EOT]  grandes y rindisimos riquisimos [EOT]  really [EOU]  shit [EOT]  una amiga de ella que trabaja en la corte con tu hermana se los regalo [EOT]  tu no sabes que ya la mata mia d el mango ya no tiene ya no la queda ni

  no te puedes mover entonces [EOU]  no te puedes sentar [EOT]  yeah you can [EOU]  they 're just a a lot more closer to the skin [EOU]  very close [EOT]  pero eso te da un calor [EOT]  no they actually they they do n't [EOT]  no 
  and then add it onto this [EOU]  but then i would have to like run wires through each door [EOU]  and so it 's a pain in the ass to install too [EOU]  besides the fact that it 's you know the fifty bucks each [EOU]  then installation is even more [EOT]  so it 's it 'sgon na be two hundred bucks [EOT]  it 's only let me see [EOU]  ok let me 
  ah y para que es eso [EOT]  it 's good because it it um makes your muscles stronger [EOU]  and it keeps you in shape [EOT]  yo creo que eso tambien te va a hacer crecer el cucu [EOU]  yo te veo [EOT]  o_k abuela [EOU]  random [EOT]  oye y las ninas que estan en el 
  but i guess in a way like in college i 'm trying to do my best that i can [EOU]  you know and then i realize i 'm like [EOU]  because i never thought like i would look at those like like smart kids and stuff [EOU]  and it 's like nah [EOU]  and like i wish i could go back [EOU]  and like get like bright futures and all that crazy stuff and [EOT]  well [EOU]  it 's it

  hey [EOT]  in london we get the cruise [EOU]  i mean the el bote el bote el el boat [EOT]  you go to the cruise [EOU]  you [EOU]  the boat [EOU]  the cruise [EOT]  the 
  te dan treinta [EOU]  exacto treinta dias a a cuando es due o sea [EOU]  no no hay que pagar lo instantaneamente y no [EOU]  exacto [EOU]  exacto exacto exacto [EOU]  eh bueno el lo el el es [EOU]  bueno el effective date es julio [EOU]  mira aqui el effective date

  is n't it funny how that word mixes disfrutar and examinar [EOT]  disfrutar y que [EOT]  disfrutar examinar [EOT]  examinar yeah [EOT]  that 's that 's that 's interesting [EOU]  i wonder if there 's some [EOU]  i mean you would know this better than i would if there 's something in history something that happened that somehow brought those two words together if it was fun to inspect [EOU]  what was when was it fun to check
