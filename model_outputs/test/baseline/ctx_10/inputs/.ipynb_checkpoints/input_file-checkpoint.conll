  they were in a in a una caja una jaula [EOU]  a chlorified cage [EOU]  and that was it [EOU]  that 's how the zoos used to be [EOU]  now that this open wide zoos are [EOU]  you know [EOU]  at least they have some semblance of something [EOU]  but i always feel bad for the big mammals [EOU]  for the big gorilla [EOU]  you know [EOU]  the the 
  i 've seen nicer ones than that one [EOU]  with the you know with the wording on it [EOU]  you know etched in you know etched inside [EOU]  yeah if you go to the liquor store they have the ones with the with the name of the company [EOT]  you want that [EOT]  yeah something with the name of the company [EOU]  you know [EOU]  what was that [EOU]  it sounded like there was a bomb [EOT]  but you you you wan na you you you wan na have dos [EOT]  whatever

  but ah so the whole idea was that but like vacilar se it has this it has this extra component built into the word of um of processing [EOU]  it 's not just visually [EOU]  it 's not it 's because you see you ca n't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like i checked out that girl [EOU]  you ca n't say like i checked her [EOU]  it 's not quite the same [EOU]  it 's i am i there there 's an aspectual there 's an aspectual component [EOU]  aspectual means like there 's a there 's a it 's a it 's more complex [EOU]  so it 's not just i went to the store it 's like i have gone to the store [EOU]  so you have the complexity of of perfective tense [EOU]  yeah so vacilar is like i i am checking her out [EOU]  and i am in the process of 
  like that you do n't really get included you know like that [EOU]  you know you hang out with the other guys and [EOT]  yeah yeah [EOT]  like i guess i guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um isabella a little bit better [EOU]  you know my cynthia 's son [EOT]  oh yeah [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  and probably fernando because honestly like i do n't know either of them like any of them like luis you know junior luis like [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and fernando like i 've met him [EOU]  and like talked to him like maybe like twice and stuff

  en otra escuela o sea yo yo le habia dicho [EOU]  eventualmente ella se va a ir [EOU]  pero le va a tirar ese problema a otra persona [EOU]  ahora es ahora la cosa es que in fifth grade e_s_e ella esta en el building de nosotros donde ella puede estar constantentemente vigilando [EOU]  y tiene personas al lado [EOU]  y ella seguro que le va a decir a las a las maestras de al lado que que sean bien vigilantes you know [EOU]  um y ademas de eso ella puede estar constantemente chequeando le los [EOU]  because ella ella es un desastre [EOU]  she does n't have plans [EOU]  she does n't have you know she comes up with things al ultimo minuto [EOU]  ella no toma eso en serio

  i mean unless like i get screwed over you know [EOT]  i guess [EOT]  yeah i 'll i mean i 'm justgon na really down play it [EOU]  like because like my whole idea is that [EOT]  it 's always no big deal [EOT]  it 's always no big deal you know [EOU]  like had she been here had she been here i would have told her [EOU]  because i told her about the event [EOU]  i told her that evening i spoke to her [EOU]  i was like [EOU]  oh like this 
  forget elizabeth i 'm going [EOT]  ok i know where you 're going with that [EOT]  ok but but like at the same time you know you know it 's not just like you know going together [EOT]  i know [EOT]  that 's not the point [EOU]  the point is going together and having a good time [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and i know you wanted to go to the concert [EOU]  so it was important you know that you had a good time [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  so when you tell me 
  how about that [EOU]  that 's her special talent [EOT]  that 's her talent [EOT]  how about that [EOU]  that 's her special talent [EOU]  dammit i did n't know that was a special talent [EOU]  because if i woulda thought that was a special talent i woulda kept on doing it [EOT] america 's most talented [EOT]  i do n't know [EOU]  apparently that 's a special talent [EOU]  well anyways so i told him so a couple of people from work have mentioned 
  porque yo tengo yo tengo una una cosa [EOT]  porque yo necesito [EOU]  yo necesito sembrar la [EOU]  tu no sabes sembrar la [EOT]  yo tengo una cosa con con tres pibos asi que es como un como una pala [EOU]  que yo pienso vaya [EOU]  uno puede coger lo [EOU]  y meter lo en la tierra [EOU]  y hacer le asi [EOU]  y hacer un hueco asi you know [EOT]  si 
  right [EOT]  you 're short [EOT]  and i think it has to do with if you 're used to seeing someone in carino [EOT]  i think [EOT]  it 's like um [EOT]  i think i 'm i swear i 'm big [EOT]  it 's kind of like with andrew [EOU]  i know andrew 's huge [EOU]  but i 've known him for so long [EOU]  it does n't shock me any_more [EOU]  it does n't 
  from the from the sink [EOU]  porque the sewer system has them in there porque [EOT]  i know i know [EOU]  yo nunca las he visto por ahi [EOT]  lo ponen ahi [EOU]  lo ponen ahi [EOU]  la unica manera que una cucaracha esa cucaracha puede estar en mi casa sin morir se [EOU]  porque en el piso por todo el piso yo ellos tienen el veneno dos meses [EOT]  si [EOT]  yo encuentro una buena y sana en mi casa es porque entro por por el sink [EOU]  te lo 
  because everybody that you know that 's your age more or less fits the bill i think [EOT]  i do n't know but [EOT]  so when you see someone it 's like short [EOT]  but i mean think of it [EOT]  does that happen to you with the shortness [EOU]  like i i know that i 'm short [EOU]  but i do n't realize it until [EOT]  i i think i 'm big [EOT]  until either i 'm standing next to someone very tall or i see someone very short [EOU]  like the other day i was in publix [EOU]  and i i 
  so much more efficient i think [EOU]  some of the time because when you take accents and stuff into play those acentos can be pretty [EOT]  yeah but in but in but in english you have you have what they what i mean what i 'mgon na call right now like like prepositional adverbials becoming becoming adjectives [EOU]  so you have uh again like a professor of french say french professor [EOU]  whereas in spanish you do n't have that [EOT]  that 's right you do n't [EOT]  there is that there is no [EOT]  there 's always de [EOT]  yeah profesor de frances [EOU]  if you say if you say profesor frances [EOT]  it means a french 
  senora usted tiene la presion usted tiene tan alta la presion que no podiamos poner la en eso [EOT]  hmm [EOT]  le digo [EOU]  que alta la tengo [EOU]  porque yo no no no pensaba [EOT]  y no te sentiste nada [EOT]  no no es que yo cuando me sube mucho la presion lo se enseguida [EOU]  pero ese dia como estaba tan nerviosa yo no [EOU]  y entonces me dice [EOU]  usted tiene trescientas quince de presion senora [EOU]  y ahi fue donde me di cuenta que ellos no me podian poner el 
  yeah [EOU]  yeah that 's [EOT]  i think right [EOT]  that 's the time [EOU]  it 's between threethirty five o'clock that they have tea [EOU]  so despues que vayamos a paris el el barco para en un puerto que se llama la habre en el sur de francia [EOU]  despues cruza a espana [EOU]  para en bilbao [EOU]  para en gijon [EOU]  despues va a lisboa [EOU]  lisboa 
  i think it 's nice and everything [EOU]  but i do n't think the degree defines who i am you know [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  it 's the degree is just a reflection of like my commitment you know of what i decided to do you know in my life you know [EOU]  like i already i had i already knew like that summer like when i came back to school that you know i wasgon na finish [EOU]  one way or another i wasgon na finish [EOU]  and the only thing that i kept telling me uh telling myself is like colin you have four years left [EOU]  you know you just have to hang in there for four years [EOU]  just keep going [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  that 's the only way i made it through

  that 's so ridiculous over that amount of people [EOT]  hey that 's why she said twelve i think instead of [EOT]  yeah but i i [EOT]  because with the group discount you get like like twelve dollars for adults [EOU]  versus seventeen it 's a huge difference [EOT]  it 's over a hundred dollars less [EOU]  but i do n't wan na pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds [EOU]  in my wedding yeah it 's our wedding day [EOU]  theygon na look at us [EOT]  no no no i mean if they wan na walk around they can go on their own [EOT]  and

  like i did n't talk to him too much yesterday about it [EOU]  i just brought it up but so [EOT]  you know i figure for the first hour we can um we can just get the questions out of the way [EOU]  it it might take an hour [EOU]  just get all write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with [EOU]  and then we have two hours to kind of practice [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  yeah we can role play [EOU]  we can you know [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  he can he can be he can be a character you know

  a cuba [EOU]  i 'm not cuban so i would n't know [EOT]  but your wife is cuban [EOT]  no she does n't wan na go to cuba [EOT]  now que que fidel que se va a morir [EOU]  now he isgon na be dead so probably they aregon na open the tourist [EOT]  no y el hermano de el el hermano todavia esta no no [EOU]  i 'm not going there [EOT]  no [EOT]  no [EOT]  so it does n't call your attention 
  we saw one at the flea market near sally 's house [EOU]  uno negro parecia parecia pelo de yuppie [EOU]  negro chiquitito asi [EOU]  mil cuatrocientos pesos [EOT]  ah [EOT]  mil cuatrocientos pesos [EOT]  oh wow [EOT]  y el hermano mil quinientos [EOU]  y tenia un tenia un otro perrito que era blanco pero estaba rosado rosado rosado pink [EOT]  si [EOT]  y y dijimos dijimos nosotros 
  yeah [EOT]  yeah yeah yeah [EOT]  so are you so are you ready for the wedding [EOT]  am i ready for the wedding [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  you know i 'm still trying to decide ah on how many days i 'mgon na spend up there [EOT]  really [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  why [EOT]  my father 's coming uh a little bit after my mom with my brother [EOT]  oh yeah i think you 're 
  si yo era la [EOT]  what about him [EOT]  ah bueno el tenia que irse a trabajar [EOU]  entonces el se va [EOT]  si [EOT]  y le digo yo [EOU]  tito yo he buscado [EOU]  yo he buscado [EOU]  y no encuentro la cucaracha [EOU]  imaginate [EOU]  pero era de las largas 
  y voy a ir a conseguir [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  you know yo tengo que ir [EOU]  y tratar de conseguir [EOT]  y tratar [EOT]  eso yo trate de conseguir lo tambien [EOU]  no se me hizo [EOT]  que hiciste para conseguir lo [EOT]  no se me hizo facil [EOT]  no [EOT]  eso fue una amiga que tenia un tenia algunos de esos 
  no y el hermano de el el hermano todavia esta no no [EOU]  i 'm not going there [EOT]  no [EOT]  no [EOT]  so it does n't call your attention [EOT]  no [EOU]  para nada [EOU]  maybe para visitar a la familia de ella pero [EOT]  con el manicure hecho [EOT]  con el manicure hecho esta bien [EOT]  so 
  no no no no because the thing is it 's [EOU]  ok it 's like the two part ones where you have the base [EOU]  and then you have i guess a a cage on top which is um in i guess in the shape of a canopy [EOT]  yeah no on the bottom it 's open [EOT]  so if you knock it off uhhuh [EOT]  ah it 's a stupid piece of crap then [EOT]  so the the dog knocked it over [EOT]  and the parrot was not too bright [EOT]  those parrots have their wings clipped most of the time [EOT]  oh that 's right they ca n't fly [EOT]  yeah they 
  so that means that there 's a little connection that lets me do it with this key [EOT]  you wan na rewire or [EOT]  ok he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver [EOU]  ok [EOT]  how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other [EOT]  because there 's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote [EOU]  and then it turn it it makes the the the motors on the on the windows go down [EOU]  he just unplugged that from that receiver [EOU]  and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the on the module for this one [EOU]  because i can plug in whatever i want to it [EOT]  mmhm 
  wait [EOU]  espera te [EOT]  you can [EOU]  but she 's [EOU]  it 'll extend [EOT]  it 's it 's long [EOU]  it 'll extend [EOU]  look look look [EOU]  look what ken gave me ok [EOT]  why [EOT]  mira lo que me dio 
  she is actually putting of her own money [EOU]  like she [EOT]  yeah but i think that they [EOU]  i do n't know [EOT]  and so now what 's happening is basically what they 're saying is that in order for barack to win like the entire election in order for him to become president he has to basically get her support [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  so he can get so he can get the rest of the democrats that she has because she has a couple [EOU]  they want him to get the rest of the democrats [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and if 
  yeah [EOT]  and papi [EOT]  no [EOT]  mami 's [EOU]  mami [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  i wan na play over there [EOT]  where [EOT]  now go there a little bit [EOT]  you know where the cats were [EOU]  they were under the 
  tu sabes lo que gente usa [EOT]  yeah but that 's not the same [EOU]  because if you go on the floor you can really hurt yourself with those [EOT]  es mas que hurt yourself [EOU]  probably you can hurt the wood [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  in that place [EOT]  that 's why [EOT]  si donde juegan beisbol basquetbol no [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  oh 
  and see whet er we picked the colour [EOU]  we may have [EOU]  the only the other thing is that they also did n't say [EOU]  you know [EOU]  verify brand and colour [EOU]  of the serving line [EOU]  stainless steel [EOU]  yeah i do n't think we picked anything [EOU]  no lo que es lo que le dije a hannah [EOU]  they are crunched with time [EOU]  they 're going to slide 
  ah whatever [EOU]  i do n't want to talk about it any_more [EOT]  yes yes let 's not let 's not [EOT]  anyways there will be more [EOU]  ok [EOT]  there will be more [EOU]  oh so now you 're saying there will be more concerts [EOT]  yes [EOU]  there will be [EOU]  and i 'mgon na make sure that you go that you go with me the next one [EOU]  because i

  so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the for the fricking chairs [EOT]  yeah because they only had a hundred chairs [EOT]  oh come on [EOU]  that 's not our problem [EOT]  uh you what [EOU]  i 'm justgon na leave the hundred chairs [EOU]  and the kids can sit on their parents laps [EOU]  or you know do whatever the hell [EOU]  oh and um they do n't close down the the park if you have a wedding [EOU]  they it 's uh still open to the public [EOT]  i do n't like

  yeah but that 's an exception [EOT]  those are the only ones i have [EOT]  but other than that really white shoes are for viejas [EOT]  ay me has dicho vieja [EOT]  no but not those [EOT]  how dare you [EOT]  no but not those [EOT]  no those are very fansy_shmansy [EOT]  those arespectacular [EOU]  those are beyond fansy_shmansy [EOU]  well anyways so mi viejo 
  entonces la principal fue adentro de la clase er que you know to find out what happened [EOU]  how could this child just walk out [EOU]  entonces habian dejado habia there was like an electricalcord that did n't keep the door from closing all the way [EOU]  the child snuck out [EOT]  but this is from your school [EOT]  yeah from her class [EOT]  where are you going [EOU]  ok hurry up because i do n't want you to leave your brother out there alone [EOT]  and um the the child snuck out [EOU]  so she the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again [EOU]  porque dice que 
  e_s_e [EOU]  well that 's exactly what she needs over here [EOU]  pero ella no quiere traer a alguien [EOU]  tu sabes she goes [EOT]  so then tell them that they have to leave again [EOT]  no no [EOU]  because she 's been working there less than three years [EOU]  she has to get that approved [EOU]  she you know it 's the bureaucracy [EOU]  it takes a while [EOU]  so she 
  who did she design for herself or for other people [EOU]  because if she designs for herself and she tells you this looks good i 'm sorry con excuse me but that does not look good [EOU]  i i 'm sorry [EOT]  huh [EOT]  i bet you she did n't say that [EOU]  i bet [EOU]  i do n't believe it [EOU]  i know magda [EOU]  she would n't say that [EOT]  what [EOT]  that this looks good

  i mean i 'm notgon na i 'm notgon na be anything above and beyond courteous above and beyond respectful [EOU]  i mean i that that 's that 's my main thing [EOU]  i wan na be respectful [EOU]  because because again like whether whether the the officers [EOU]  i mean i 'm i 'm i think she deserves respect just as an individual [EOU]  but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically [EOU]  it 's a matter of in the proceedings [EOU]  the proceedings have to be treated with respect [EOU]  because given that it 's so wishy washy given that it 's so shifty and unstructured respect isgon na factor in [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  you know if we 're

  i do n't know if i told you that [EOU]  and i just did n't respond [EOU]  and i told gloria because [EOT]  sunshine [EOT]  hundred percent if she 's notgon na give herself a hundred percent [EOU]  it 's not worth it [EOU]  i have enough to do [EOU]  i 've to work on the fricking formatting crap [EOT]  sunshine be careful [EOT]  it was very minor what they told me i had to change [EOT]  what

  like you ca n't [EOU]  like that you do n't really get included you know like that [EOU]  you know you hang out with the other guys and [EOT]  yeah yeah [EOT]  like i guess i guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um isabella a little bit better [EOU]  you know my cynthia 's son [EOT]  oh yeah [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  and probably fernando because honestly like i do n't know either of them like any of them like luis you know junior luis like [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and fernando 
  i mean i told you i was mad for like one day [EOU]  and then i was like forget it [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  yeah [EOT]  i did n't i did n't [EOT]  i felt really bad [EOU]  but i just felt the whole thing was just misunderstood [EOU]  it was [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  all right i do n't want to talk about it any_more [EOU]  it 's like old

  so why why do you think that i was like mad at you [EOU]  i do n't understand [EOT]  because hello you did n't talk to me the whole sunday [EOT]  actually no the reason why is because like like i kind of felt bad like about what happened [EOU]  and i do n't really want like for me to be the issue like between you and my mom [EOU]  you know like i do n't want that i do n't want myself to come up in like anyway or form possible like [EOT]  mmhm [EOT]  and it 's and like kind of i was just kind of like [EOU]  well you know like like i do n't know what to do [EOU]  because the thing is like the thing is i you know [EOT]  mmhm

  not impossible that 's doable [EOT]  you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each [EOU]  and they let you control [EOU]  and then add it onto this [EOU]  but then i would have to like run wires through each door [EOU]  and so it 's a pain in the ass to install too [EOU]  besides the fact that it 's you know the fifty bucks each [EOU]  then installation is even more [EOT]  so it 's it 'sgon na be two hundred bucks [EOT]  it 's only let me see [EOU]  ok let me 
  show me [EOT]  o_k [EOU]  one [EOT]  ah y para que es eso [EOT]  it 's good because it it um makes your muscles stronger [EOU]  and it keeps you in shape [EOT]  yo creo que eso tambien te va a hacer crecer el cucu [EOU]  yo te veo [EOT]  o_k abuela [EOU]  random [EOT]  oye y las ninas que estan en el

  yeah i i i asked carlos [EOU]  and he said he says he 's down to to um to oversee today 's proceedings with todd and stuff [EOT]  interesting ok [EOU]  um [EOT]  i think i think he 'sgon na offer a good good perspectives like good notes [EOU]  like i did n't talk to him too much yesterday about it [EOU]  i just brought it up but so [EOT]  you know i figure for the first hour we can um we can just get the questions out of the way [EOU]  it it might take an hour [EOU]  just get all write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with [EOU]  and then we have two 
  estamos conectados [EOU]  i guess we could hop in the car with it and go get it [EOU]  it 's portable [EOU]  do you want to [EOU]  just hop in the car and go get some pastelitos [EOT]  no [EOU]  no [EOU]  y lo dejamos ahi como baby_sitting [EOT]  yeah he could be baby_sitting [EOU]  he 's outside right now [EOU]  i mean apparently he 's keeping the kids entertained 
  de ese tamano no me no me no me puede entrar en la casa [EOT]  ah [EOT]  no tengo espacio en la casa [EOU]  i have the er [EOT]  al lado de la escalera te quedaria [EOT]  nah [EOU]  no you know what [EOU]  the only place i would put it would have been where the fish tank is [EOU]  but the fish tank is taking up that spot so [EOU]  unfortunately that 's it [EOT]  pero tu me dices que 
  nah [EOT]  it 's been [EOU]  i mean i mean i if i had to choose like if i could keep it in perfect form [EOU]  but i like to bend my books back [EOU]  i like to write in them [EOU]  take notes [EOU]  carry them everywhere [EOU]  and if i have big cargo pockets put them in big cargo pockets [EOU]  so [EOT]  this isgon na be in as well [EOU]  i 'm pretty sure we 
  usted lo hace a las siete un dia usted me avisa [EOU]  y yo lo hago en mi casa [EOU]  y asi acabamos [EOU]  y se acabaron [EOU]  no habian ni en el hall se veia una asi [EOT]  yeah [EOU]  ah good [EOT]  se acabaron por completo gracias a dios [EOU]  pero tuvo que mudar se esa mujer para que yo no tuviera una [EOU]  porque eran mal eran terribles para para terminarl as [EOT]  i know 
  no [EOT]  nadie en el team tu tienes clase [EOT]  well the first um with one of them i do [EOU]  so [EOT]  cuenta me como a ti te gusta el colegio este [EOU]  como tu comparas este colegio con el colegio anterior [EOU]  how do you like it [EOT]  i like it [EOU]  it 's better than my old school [EOU]  y the people are so much nicer [EOT]  they 
  so i 'm excited about that [EOU]  but i 'm nervous because like oh my god [EOU]  i do n't know twenty people and stuff so [EOT]  no i mean i mean for the most part like my mom tends to hang out with um uh cynthia [EOU]  cynthia [EOT]  mmhm mmhm [EOT]  so whatever you 'll get to know her [EOU]  and cynthia you already know [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  and cynthia is just her sister you know so [EOU]  that 's it

  so maybe it does have a little bit to do with people growing [EOT]  i think if you slow down i think it would be still as important [EOU]  because it 's not it 's to be honest with you it is it 's not about the presents [EOU]  it 's really more about the feelings that you get and you know like what you want [EOT]  christmas spirit [EOT]  yeah exactly [EOT]  yeah [EOT]  you know like that anxiety of like getting up at like twelve a_m in the morning to open up your gift [EOT]  i used to love christmas [EOT]  just because you want to see what your parents got you [EOT]  yeah
