  you do n't need your wife [EOU]  you have asthma [EOT]  yeah 
  if my wife says get one for him i get one for him [EOT]  ah [EOU]  no consiga me uno 
  which is not bad [EOU]  eso lo tenia que hacer yo because is through my [EOU]  you 
  because he sees people all the time in the cars [EOT]  si people si [EOU]  but he never has seen a cat 
  restraining order [EOU]  yeah [EOT]  that 's it

  i 'mgon na ask my wife [EOU]  is that what it is [EOT]  listen 
  i must have been four [EOU]  nowhere [EOU]  i do i can not 
  pobrecita you know she 's alone [EOU]  and you know how it is [EOU]  so every time that she goes fortherapy she 'll ask you a thousand and one questions 
  remember alberto [EOT]  oh yeah [EOT]  que he had aliver transplant 
  porque tu padre le gustaban esas cosas [EOT]  claro [EOT]  a mi no se 
  yeah for [EOT]  because [EOT]  well 
  does that happen to you with the shortness [EOU]  like i i know that i 'm short [EOU]  but

  i have the teachers on one side expecting me to do everything [EOT]  tienes que tu sabes [EOT]  i have 
  you know that 's actually that 's actually another reason why i prefer to write in english as to writing in spanish [EOU]  because english does allow you to be a little ambiguous which means you can have so many more double meanings at times [EOU]  and makes

  because i had told her if she comes back what we need to do is do n't put her in do n't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what 's going on [EOU]  and so she goes [EOU]  yeah but i think she 's only certified for pre_k 
  i think it was because she was n't doing so good [EOU]  i 'm not sure because maybe that 's what they thought [EOU]  pero
